        <p>Astrology and Ayurveda are deeply connected with each other. The Ayurvedic system is not only the traditional system of medicine but also a unique approach to holistic science and the oldest healing science as well as the world's medicine for tomorrow. Ayurveda have always emphasised on the Spirituality  concept  as of prime  importance. The broad possibility of Ayurvedic science is due to its three-dimensional holistic approach towards health viz physical, mental and spiritual energy. 

        <p>Astrological sciences suggest 10 types of remedial measures in the treatment of diseases. This science considers that causative factors of various disorders are the Navagrahas (nine planets). The influence of the planets on various procedures like drug processing, bath taking, performing Yajna, wearing Ratna, wearing Rudraksha etc.
            </p>
        <p>In this case, the Rudraksha bead works as a protective shield that safeguards its wearer from negative energies. Rudraksha influences the mind through its subtle electromagnetic properties, and many diseases can be cured when wearing Rudraksha by streamlining the thought process as it maintains a stable and calm mind to make the body strong and strengthens the immune system, which prevents diseases.
            </p>
        <p>We are providing you the Special Spiritual Healing through Mangalapathy Ayurveda.

        <p>We guide the clients for suitable Yoga classes according to their disease.
        It's really simple.</p>
            
        <p>Yoga is mentioned in Ayurvedic texts such as the Charaka Samhita. Yoga is important for dissolving physical stress and calming the mind before meditation and is central to dinacharya, the Ayurvedic routine. It is the ideal Ayurvedic exercise, because it rejuvenates the body, improves digestion, and removes stress. Meanwhile in yoga there is a similar focus on using natural methods, with yoga involving the physical movement and stretching of our bodies along with quieting the mind and being at one with the world around us to achieve its results. Ultimately, both focus on utilising the power of nature and being in tune with our own bodies and surroundings to see the best results.</p>
