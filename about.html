            Mangalapathy Ayurveda was established to enhance the holistic services of hereditary Ayurvedic practitioners by Dr. R. Mangalambigai Ammal. She brought the experience of generations of Ayurvedic service as the chief physician at the centre. Mangalapathy Ayurveda began its journey at a time when the Ayurvedic products were regarded with insignificance and also the crisis situation was severe in Jaffna.  Even though we earned a remarkable reputation by the intensive focus on formulating the Ayurvedic medicines through the knowledge gained from several India visits. The Centre has been providing high-quality medicines along with Traditional food supplements in certified standards by the leading team of experienced doctors.
